# Welcome!

This is the front end portion of a deck of cards application. Users can create, delete and draw cards from decks.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repo and run ```npm install``` to install necessary packages.

Once done, run ```npm start``` to start your react server. Please run this on a port other than 3000 as the backend routes are set up on 3000. Simply starting up the back end first will allow it to run on port 3000 and react will default to 3001.

Once both your front end and back end are running, you're good to go!
